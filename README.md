## Hey, I'm Reem! 👋 

🎓 I'm a **Biomedical Science Graduate** hoping to rediscover my love for coding.  
🔬 My degree has kept me busy over the past few years, but I’m excited to get back into it and refresh my skills!  
🤓 Although I'm still a **beginner**, my projects helped me build a stronger understanding of coding, both in **Python** and in general, and I've come a long way since I first learned to code in 2018 (with A LOT of help from Google 🫣😂).
