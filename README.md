🫶🏼 I love biology, enjoy coding, and am curious about how they can overlap to make a difference

### ⬆️ What I'm Up To
💻 Refreshing my Python skills and working on some new projects!  
🔍 Hunting for a graduate job

<!--
🎓 I'm a Biomedical Science Graduate hoping to rediscover coding.  
🔬 My degree has kept me busy over the past few years, but I’m excited to get back into it and refresh my skills!  
🤓 Although I'm still a beginner, my projects helped me build a stronger understanding of coding, both in Python and in general, and I've come a long way since I first learned to code in 2018 (with A LOT of help from Google 🫣😂).
